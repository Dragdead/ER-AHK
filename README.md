# ER-AHK-shenanigans
Probably not going to work

The singular goal of this AHK script is to make Elden Ring playable on Keyboard & Mouse on a WASD layout without conflicting keybinds

Current ER-related issues with the actual K&M setup inlude but not limited to :
- RR1s being near impossible to do due to the lack of interval between running attacks (RR2)
- R2s for the following weapon classes are impossible to charge due to the feint mechanic : GKat, TS, HTS and any other weapon class with a kick cancel
- The whole menu control section from DS3 is missing, along a few other options. Every single keybind below is reserved by ER and thus cannot be remapped
  - Open menu (ESC)
  - Move Cursor (Up/Down/Right/Left) (Directional arrows respectively) 
  - Confirm (E)
  - Cancel (A) <--- Conflict with movement keys
  - Switch tab (Left/Right) (W/and something else I'll figure it out later) <--- Conflict with movement keys
  - Function 1 (R)
  - Function 2 (F)
  - Function 3 (Y) <--- Ideally should be (N) 
  - Scroll (Up/Down) (C/V)
  - Window Scroll (Up/Down) (Mouse Weel Up/Down) 
  - Sort (T?)
  - Open Help Menu (? or Right click)
  - Two-hand weapon (E + Left click/Right click)
The main consequence of these conflicts is that hardswapping is impossible, added annoyances include cancelling any interaction with a menu (NPC/Main Menu)
