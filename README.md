## ER-AHK-shenanigans

The singular goal of this AHK script is to make Elden Ring playable on Keyboard & Mouse on a WASD layout without conflicting keybinds.

### Issues with Elden Ring's Native Keyboard & Mouse Setup

<i> Current ER-related issues with the actual KB&M setup include but are not limited to: </i>

- RR1s being near impossible to do due to the lack of interval between R1 and RR2  
- R2s for the following weapon classes are impossible to fully charge due to the feint mechanic taking priority when inputting Shift:  
  - GKat  
  - TS  
  - HTS   
- The whole menu control section from DS3 is missing, along with a few other options. Every single keybind below is reserved by ER and thus cannot be remapped:
